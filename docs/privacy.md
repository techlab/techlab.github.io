# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 2026**

## Introduction

TechLaboratory ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our website and open-source projects.

## Website Visitors

The Website collects non-personally identifying information such as the browser type, operating system, language preference, referring site and date and time of each request. We also collect potentially-personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users. 

Our purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how site visitors use the website and to improve our projects and documentation. We will not publicly release potentially-personally identifying information.

## Interacting Users

Certain users of the Website (supporters, commenters, contributors, etc.) choose to interact with the site. For example, users who wish to comment about certain topics or contribute to our projects may be asked to provide contact information such as name, email address, etc. that are used to contact them as necessary. 

We will not publicly release this information provided by the users. Any code contributions you make to our open-source projects will be publicly visible on GitHub according to the nature of open-source development.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

The Website may use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit the site. This could include only showing you special content once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features. 

You can choose to disable or selectively turn off cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with the site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to some of the services or programs that use cookies.

## Advertisements

The Website uses third-party advertisements to support our site. We use **Carbon Ads**, an ethical advertising network that serves privacy-focused ads to developers and designers.

### Carbon Ads

Carbon Ads may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site. This will send Carbon Ads information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have certain plugins installed. This is generally used for:
- Geotargeting purposes (showing relevant ads based on your location)
- Showing certain ads based on specific sites visited
- Frequency capping to avoid showing the same ad too many times

Carbon Ads is committed to privacy and does not track users across websites. For more information about Carbon Ads' privacy practices, please visit [Carbon Ads Privacy Policy](https://www.carbonads.net/privacy.html).

### Google Analytics

We may also use Google Analytics to understand how visitors interact with our website. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as:
- Pages visited
- Time spent on pages
- Links clicked
- Browser type and version

You can opt-out of Google Analytics by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Our website and projects use third-party services such as:
- **GitHub** - for code hosting and collaboration
- **NPM** - for package distribution
- **Carbon Ads** - for ethical advertising
- **Google Analytics** - for website analytics (if enabled)

These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them:
